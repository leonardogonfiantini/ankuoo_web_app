## How to install

First of all, initialize the db, remember to change the url of your mongodb, you can use this command:

`npm run db`

You can run the server with this command, the server will run on port 3000, you can change it on file index.js:

`npm start`

Remember to change the ip in script.py, in my case i setted the plug with 192.168.1.85, but you can change it.

----

This version has MongoDb Atlas api, so in .env you have to change it with your link.
